Licenced under the GPL version 3, see LICENCE - in addition to this you are required to attribute JSLBot and link to the source repository prominently near the top of your documentation and ANY sales related listings or material.  e.g.
"Created using JSLBot (c) Iain Price : https://github.com/JSLBot"

(c) Iain Price, 2016-

Please consider that you have received this software for free.

Preferentially speaking, I'm happy with the idea that people build on this foundation, provided they're not just exploiting the existing work without adding value.

E.g., things that seem reasonable to profit from
* Your time via support, configuration, documentation; documentation should ideally be GPLed and contributed back to the repository, otherwise the charges should be minimal for what ought to be light work.
* Your time via module development, note that derivatives of JSLBot must also be under the GPL, and ideally you will contribte your work back to the repository.
* Additional services - e.g. if you're selling a complex service where the bot only forms a minor function (e.g. a land rental service), or you're providing hosting.

What I'm trying to avoid is:
* The person who compiles a jar in 30 seconds, slams it on a web host, links it via a notecard with 5 lines of "how to" and sells it on the market place.
The requirement to link back to the repository should help undermine such minimal efforts, as I can offer this service myself, for less, or free, depending on my muse at the time.

Use, take, contribute.  Typical open source stuff.  Try not to be a jerk :)


Open to discussing alternative licences if you wish to sell a proprietary product without having to GPL stuff (e.g. pets etc would be extensive modifications of JSLBot but still ultimately covered under the GPL).

Bear in mind as I write this I don't even have a published repository, yet alone anyone else using this, yet alone anyone caring what the licence is.  I can always change it later if it needs to be more permissive; I don't see the need to make it more restrictive, this isn't a money making project for me, just returning the favour.
